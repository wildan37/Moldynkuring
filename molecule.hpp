// Molecule Class
// Idea behind this class is to collect all the objects called atoms that have all same properties.
// later on an object called atom having position, velocity, and acceleration with the vector data type.
// and the properties governed from those 3 vectors(position, velocity, acceleration) are potential and kinetic that will have double data type.
